First we put the link of the bootstrap in the head section

then we put what we want from it in our code 

also we can put some flexbox styling for positioning


12 Column System 

contianer 
    row 
        col columns ( the items that we have )


Bootstraps break points 

col-sm-2 // the dimesion ration is 2 columns of the 12  and for the sm is for the responsive  
col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4 // this means that for large make it 4/12 but for medium use 8/12 and so on
